Monitoring data structuring and enrichment\r\n1. Elasticity Space and Boundary analysis\r\n1. Elasticity Pathway analysis\r\n\r\n## Background\r\nIn order to analyze the elastic behavior of cloud services, MELA uses the concept of elasticity boundary. An elasticity boundary describes the upper and lower allowed values over a set of metrics for a Cloud application. Another MELA core concept is elasticity space. An elasticity space is determined via an elasticity space function and captures all runtime metrics described in the user-defined elasticity boundary when a monitored element is in elastic behavior.  Based on the elasticity space, MELA provides a mechanism for extracting characteristics of the elasticity space that can be used to predict its behavior, characteristics called “elasticity pathway”.  An elasticity pathway function is designed to perform a complex evaluation of the cloud service behavior, extracting characteristics that can be used to predict its behavior. \r\n\r\nMELA contains a core MELA Service, and a lightweight Data Collector node (Figure 19). The Data Collector node is a customizable component that gathers from existing monitoring solutions monitoring data, associates it with the application structure (e.g., VM metrics or Service Level metrics), and sends it for processing and analysis to the MELA Service. \r\n\r\nMonitoring data is usually associated with a single level, e.g., virtual infrastructure, service topology or service unit.  An important MELA feature is the linking of these levels through multi-level metric aggregation, which implies a configuration, defining for the monitored elements at each level metric composition operations to be applied. \r\n\r\nAll functionality is exposed through REST services.\r\n\r\nFor compiling and deploying MELA check [ Compiling and Deployment section ](https://github.com/tuwiendsg/MELA/wiki/Compiling-and-Deployment) \r\n\r\n## Acknowledgment\r\n\r\nThis work was partially supported by the European Commission in terms of the CELAR FP7 project (FP7-ICT-2011-8 #317790)\r\n\r\nFor any research work in which MELA is used, please cite the following articles:\r\n* Daniel Moldovan, Georgiana Copil, Hong-Linh Truong, Schahram Dustdar, [MELA: Monitoring and Analyzing Elasticity of Cloud Services](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6753781), 5'th International Conference on Cloud Computing, CloudCom.
