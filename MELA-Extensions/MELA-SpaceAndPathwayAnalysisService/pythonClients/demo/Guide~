Connect to the ComotVM hosting MELA and rSYBL:
 - ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/dmoldovan.pem  ubuntu@128.130.172.216

to start MELA (from the 10.99.0.35 COMOTVM):
./MELA/MELA-DataService/target/mela-data-service start
and then
./MELA/MELA-AnalysisService/target/mela-analysis-service start

to start rSYBL service:
./apache-tomcat-7.0.52/bin/catalina.sh start

To stop them: the same, but with stop :)

rSYBL allready has metric configuration rules defined for the DaaS.

You have python clients to submit service structure, composition rules, and  requirements in "mela_clients" for MELA, and in "rSYBL_clients" for rSYBL. The DaaS structure si embedded in the lient example xmls.

I would recommend starting and interract with MELA,a nd after everything goes fine, then submit to rSYBL which also controls things (notice the a bit different formats we are using for service structure and requirements).
